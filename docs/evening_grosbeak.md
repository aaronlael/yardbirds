**The Evening Grosbeak**

image female | image male <- coming soon

These birds apparently travel in large groups but we've only seen two pair in our yard so far.  They look like a much larger finch and have really awesome yellow "eyebrows" on the males.  I think the eyebrows sort of look more like an 1980's headband.

**Summary of DWR Article via QuillBot**:

The evening grosbeak, a bird of prey, breeds in the western and northern US, Canada, and Mexico. It prefers woodland habitats, particularly coniferous forests, and may be a rare breeder in northeastern Utah. Nests are built in trees six to sixty feet above the ground, and the female lays a clutch of eggs in late spring. The evening grosbeak eats buds and seeds, but occasionally consumes insects. It migrates irregularly eastward and southward, and its habitat includes coniferous forests, residential areas, parks, and cemeteries.
