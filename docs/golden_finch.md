**The American Goldfinch**

image female | image male <- coming soon

These are a little more rare in the yard than house finches, but we still see them from time to time.  They aren't big fans of the suet feeders but can be seen going after the songbird seed mix in our various seed feeders and picking up scatterings off of the ground.
