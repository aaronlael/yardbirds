**The American Goldfinch**

image female | image male <- coming soon

These are a little more rare in the yard than house finches, but we still see them from time to time.  They aren't big fans of the suet feeders but can be seen going after the songbird seed mix in our various seed feeders and picking up scatterings off of the ground.

**Summary of DWR Article via QuillBot:**

The American goldfinch, Carduelis tristis, breeds in southern Canada and the United States, with nomadic flocks traveling widely in search of food. It feeds mainly on seeds, with occasional insects. Nesting dates are among the latest of North American passerines, with eggs laid in June or early April. Nests are built by the female alone using materials like roots, plant fibers, wool, and spider silk. Young are cared for by both parents, with the female alone feeding them with food brought by the male for the first few days after hatching. The species range extends from southern Canada to northern Baja California, Arizona, New Mexico, and southern Florida. Migrations peak from mid-April to early June and late October to mid-December. American goldfinches are associated with weedy fields, cultivated lands, open deciduous and riparian woodland, forest edge, shrubbery, orchards, and farmlands.
