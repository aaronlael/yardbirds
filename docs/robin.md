**Summary of DWR Article via QuillBot:**

The American robin, Turdus migratorius, breeds in North America and migrates south for winter. It is common in Utah and can be found in various habitats, including woodlands, scrublands, wetlands, fields, and suburban settings. American robins primarily forage on the ground, consuming terrestrial insects and worms, and fruits. They are active throughout the day, most active near dawn and dusk. Their migrations begin in August and vary by location.
