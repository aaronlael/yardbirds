**The Mourning Dove**

image female | image male <- coming soon

Some folks think these birds are pidgeons, but they aren't.  It's totally ok to let them stay up late or drive the bus (haha).
They have a very distinctive call (always screaming) and love to pick up seeds off of the ground that others cast off from the feeders.

**Summary of DWR Article via QuillBot:**

The mourning dove, a popular upland game bird in North America, is found in 48 of the 50 states and is taken by hunters each year. It has adapted to man-made habitats, preferring open fields and abundant food. The male and female remain paired during the nesting season, with the male helping with nest building, incubation, brooding, and feeding. Seeds make up over 90% of the dove's diet. The dove is migratory and falls under migratory bird treaty and federal regulations.
