**The Mourning Dove**

image female | image male <- coming soon

Some folks think these birds are pidgeons, but they aren't.  It's totally ok to let them stay up late or drive the bus (haha).
They have a very distinctive call (always screaming) and love to pick up seeds off of the ground that others cast off from the feeders.
