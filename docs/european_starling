**The European Starling**

image female | image male <- coming soon

For the longest time I thought these little birds were grackles, but they are not.  The easy visual identifier that separates them from grackles is their beige contrasting beak!
These birds love the suet blocks because they cannot easily open seeds found in our other hanging feeders.  You can commonly see two of them hanging off of the same suet feeder, spinning in circles.
