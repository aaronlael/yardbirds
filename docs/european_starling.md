**The European Starling**

For the longest time I thought these little birds were grackles, but they are not.  The easy visual identifier that separates them from grackles is their beige contrasting beak!
These birds love the suet blocks because they cannot easily open seeds found in our other hanging feeders.  You can commonly see two of them hanging off of the same suet feeder, spinning in circles.

**Summary of DWR Article via QuillBot**:

The European starling is a bird native to Europe, Asia, and northern Africa, introduced to the United States in 1890. It is often associated with urban areas, farmlands, and disturbed or non-native habitats. Starlings nest in cavities, often using available nesting holes to the exclusion of native cavity nesters like woodpeckers, flycatchers, and wood ducks. Males choose nesting holes and construct loose nests of sticks, leaves, and other plant material. Females visit territories, choose mates by their songs, and finish building the nests. Typically, five to seven eggs are laid, and young are able to fly after twenty days but are dependent on the parents for five days after they leave the nest.
