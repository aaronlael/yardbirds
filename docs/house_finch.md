**The House Finch**

image female | image male <- coming soon

The most common bird we see in our yard.  These little buggers keep the bird feeders bustling with activity and song.  The males are noted by the red markings on their heads while the females of the sepcies have more of a muted brown and grey color scheme.
You'll regularly see these around our seed feeders and the ground beneath enjoying black sunflower seeds and millet.
